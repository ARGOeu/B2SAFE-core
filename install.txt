*** Dependencies ***

*** Installation ***

This Setup describes the procedure to enable the BE2SAFE module for iRODS 3.3

Enable the module,

Automatically:

1.1. enable the module in "<irods>/modules/BE2SAFE/info.txt"
1.2. rerun the irodssetup script

Manually:

1.1. <irods>/scripts/configure --enable-BE2SAFE
1.2. make clean
1.3. make
1.4 <irods>/irodsctl restart


2. create a symbolic link to the eudat rulebase
	cd <irods>
	ln -s <absolute-irods-path>/modules/BE2SAFE/rulebase/eudat.re ./server/config/reConfigs/eudat.re

3. edit <irods>/server/config/server.config and append ",eudat" to "reRuleSet" 
	(make sure to include the comma and no spaces)

4. configure iRODS hooks.
	edit the <irods>/server/config/reConfigs/core.re file and add the following two acPostProcForPutHooks:

	acPostProcForPut {
        	ON($objPath like "\*.replicate") {
                	processReplicationCommandFile($objPath);
        	}
	}
	acPostProcForPut {
        	ON($objPath like "\*.pid.create") {
                	processPIDCommandFile($objPath);
       	 	}
	}

5. properly configure the default resource in <irods>/server/config/reConfigs/core.re

6.1 install the python scripts
	cd <irods>
        ln -s <absolute-irods-path>/modules/BE2SAFE/cmd/* ./server/bin/cmd/
        check permissions on the scripts and make sure they are executable by the irods user
            e.g.chmod u+x cmd/*

6.2 update the "getEpicApiParameters" rule in "./server/config/reConfigs/eudat.re"
    - Configure the credential storage type: "os": stored on the local filesystem or "irods": stored on de irods namespace.
    - Set the path to the credentials file
    - set the correct serverID to include the fully qualified hostname. For instance: "irods://node.domain.com:1247"
    - Set the proper values in the credentials file (see ./cmd/credentials_example for an example)
    - Set the proper values in ./cmd/authz.map.json

7. create a shared space in all zones as configured in the eudat.re rulebase getSharedCollection function.
        - defaults to "<zone>/replicate"
        - make sure all users involved in the replication can write in this collection.

8.0.1 change "#!/home/proirod1/.pythonbrew/pythons/Python-2.7/bin/python" in epicclient.py to yout python installation
8.0.2 install httplib2, simplejson and pylint:
	httplib2
	download from http://code.google.com/p/httplib2
	python setup.py install

	simplejson
	download from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/simplejson/
	python setup.py install

	ubuntu: apt-get install python-httplib2 python-simplejson

	ubuntu: apt-get install pylint
  
8.1 test the epic api interaction by running the "./cmd/epicclient.py test" script manually and with "iexecmd epicclient.py"
8.2 test the replication by changing and triggering "replicate.r" rule in <irods>/modules/BE2SAFE/rules

DATACENTER only:

it is necessary to configure the authz.map.json file in order to allow user to execute rules, which calls external scripts.

*** Command files ***

The command files are written to the shared iRODS space and are used to control replications and PID management

1) *.replicate

    Contains a list of replication commands separated by commas:
        command1,command2,command3

    Each replication command contains three parameters, separated by a semicolon:
        "*pid;*source;*destination"
            *pid            the handle of the source object  
            *source         the iRODS location of the source object
            *destination    the iRODS location of the destination object (will be created if it does not exist)

2) *.pid.create

    Contains a command to create a new PID:

    "create;*pid;*destination"
        *pid                the handle of the source object (the parent)
        *destination        the iRODS location of the destination object 

3) *.pid.update

    Contians a command to update a PID:
    
    "update;*pid;*new_pid"
        *pid            the handle of the source object (the parent)
        *new_pid        the (generated) handle of the destination object (the child)


*** TODO ***

- improve logic and data actual written/conveyed
    --> merge pid.create and pid.update actions in a single command file
- improve error handling

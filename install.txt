*** Installation/Upgrade ***

The following describes the procedure to enable B2SAFE release-4.x.y

NOTE: iRODS is running as a normal user process. NOT as root. The package can
be build by any user. During installation of the package it will use: 
"/etc/irods/service_account.config" to set the ownership of the files.
NOTE: iRODS needs to be installed AND configured before installing/upgrading B2SAFE


It works as follows:
- clone the b2safe project as any user. NOT root
  $ git clone https://github.com/EUDAT-B2SAFE/B2SAFE-core.git
- go to the directory where the packaging files are:
  $ cd B2SAFE-core/packaging

* RPM creation, installation/upgrade *

- create package:
  $ ./create_rpm_package.sh

Try to install missing packages with the standard package manager like apt, yum, zypper etc.
If packages are not within the standards use pip and install the missing packages with pip.

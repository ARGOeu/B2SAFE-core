*** Installation ***

The following describes the procedure to enable B2SAFE pre-release-3.0 for iRODS v4.0.3.

** Through python script **

Assumptions:
iRODSv4.0.3 (Aug'14) installed.
<irods>	/var/lib/irods
<absolute-irods-path> /var/lib/irods/iRODS
<etcirods> /etc/irods

- Install B2SAFE files (e.g. git, zip, etc.)
For example, under the <irods>/ directory.
Set permissions (ref. <etcirods>/service_account.config).

cd <irods>
git clone, unzip ... 

configure b2safe.config
- choose a conf dir for the B2SAFE package (ex. CONF_DIR: /<etcirods>/b2safe-core)
- choose a log dir (ex. /<etcirods>/b2safe-core/log)
- choose the iRODS shared dir (ex. /myZone/replicate) AND create it

- run b2safe_install.py

- Install httplib2, simplejson, lxml, defusedxml, queuelib and pylint:
- test epic client

- change the following rule in eudat.re, setting the *collectionPath 
  according to the shared dir set before:

getSharedCollection(*zonePath, *collectionPath) {
    EUDATGetZoneNameFromPath(*zonePath, *zoneName)
    *collectionPath = "*zoneName/replicate/";
}

** Through binary packages **

It works as follows:
- clone the b2safe project under the user which runs irods. NOT root
  git clone …
- go to the directory where the packaging files are:
  cd B2SAFE-core/packaging

* RPM *

- create package for the user who run’s the irods instance:
  ./create_rpm_package.sh
- login as root and install package:
  rpm -ivh /home/rods/rpmbuild/RPMS/noarch/irods-eudat-b2safe-3.0-0.noarch.rpm
